# Memorandum Detail Page System

## Overview
The memorandum system has been updated to display each memorandum on its own dedicated webpage instead of using modal popups. This provides a better user experience with full-screen viewing, proper URLs for sharing, and improved accessibility.

## How It Works

### Navigation
- **From Memorandums List**: Click anywhere on a memorandum card or the "Read Full Memorandum" button
- **Direct Access**: Use URLs like `memorandum-detail.html?id=X` where X is the memo ID
- **Back Navigation**: Use the back button in the browser or the arrow button in the header

### Files Structure
- `memorandums.html` - Main memorandums listing page
- `memorandums.js` - JavaScript for the listing page
- `memorandum-detail.html` - Individual memorandum detail page template
- `memorandum-detail.js` - JavaScript for the detail page
- `memorandums.css` - Shared styles for both pages

### Features
- **Full-screen viewing** of memorandum content
- **Shareable URLs** for individual memorandums
- **Print functionality** with optimized print styles
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- **Breadcrumb navigation** for better user orientation
- **Status indicators** (Active, Archived, etc.)
- **Category and priority badges**
- **Author and date information**

### Adding New Memorandums
1. Add the memorandum data to the `memorandums` array in both:
   - `memorandums.js` 
   - `memorandum-detail.js`
2. Ensure each memorandum has a unique `id`
3. Include all required fields: `title`, `excerpt`, `category`, `priority`, `date`, `author`, `status`, `content`

### Sharing
- Use the share button on detail pages to copy URLs or use native sharing
- URLs are automatically generated for each memorandum
- Share functionality works with both native device sharing and clipboard fallback

### Print Support
- Print button available on detail pages
- Optimized print styles hide navigation and show only content
- Professional formatting for printed documents

## Technical Implementation
- Uses URL parameters to identify specific memorandums
- JavaScript handles loading and displaying content
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Progressive enhancement with fallbacks for older browsers
